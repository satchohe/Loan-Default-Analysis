This R script is for a machine learning project, which aims to predict loan defaults. It covers the entire process from data loading and preparation to training and evaluating two different machine learning models: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.

### **1\. Setup and Data Loading**

The script starts by installing and loading the necessary R packages. It then loads a CSV file named Loan\_default.csv into a data frame. The janitor::clean\_names() function is used to automatically tidy up the column names, ensuring they are in a consistent, easy-to-use format.

### **2\. Data Pre-processing**

This section focuses on preparing the data for the models.

*   **Irrelevant data removal**: The loan\_id column is removed as it's not useful for the predictive models.
    
*   **Data type conversion**: The default column, which is the target variable, is converted into a factor. This is a crucial step for classification models in R.
    
*   **Feature engineering**: The script identifies categorical columns with a low number of unique values and applies **one-hot encoding** to them. This process converts categorical data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand. This helps to avoid potential issues with how some models handle non-numerical data.
    

### **3\. Data Splitting**

The prepared data is split into two sets:

*   **Training set (80%)**: This is used to train the machine learning models.
    
*   **Testing set (20%)**: This is held back to evaluate the performance of the trained models on new, unseen data.
    

The set.seed(123) function ensures that the data is split in the same way each time the script is run, making the results reproducible.

### **4\. Model Training and Comparison**

The script trains and compares two powerful machine learning models.

#### **Random Forest Model**

1.  A **Random Forest** model is trained on the training\_set with ntree=500, which means it builds 500 decision trees.
    
2.  The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing\_set.
    
3.  A **confusion matrix** is generated using caret::confusionMatrix() to evaluate the model's performance, providing metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
    

#### **XGBoost Model**

1.  The data is prepared specifically for **XGBoost** by converting it into a matrix format.
    
2.  Key parameters for the model are defined, such as objective (binary logistic regression for binary classification) and eta (the learning rate).
    
3.  The XGBoost model is trained on the training data.
    
4.  Predictions are made on the test data and then converted into class labels (0 or 1).
    
5.  Similar to the Random Forest model, a confusion matrix is used to evaluate its performance.
    

This dual-model approach allows for a direct comparison of the two algorithms to determine which one performs better on this specific loan default dataset.
